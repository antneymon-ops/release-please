# Bolt's Journal

This journal is for capturing critical, non-routine learnings during my performance optimization work. I will only add entries for significant discoveries that help me make better decisions in the future.

## YYYY-MM-DD - Initializing Journal
**Learning:** Starting a new optimization mission. This journal will be my repository of hard-won performance wisdom.
**Action:** Log all surprising or critical findings here to build a knowledge base of what works and what doesn't in this specific codebase.
